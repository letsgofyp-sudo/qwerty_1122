# ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Pakistan-Specific Dynamic Fare Calculation System

## Overview

The Let's Go application now features a sophisticated, Pakistan-specific dynamic fare calculation system that considers current fuel prices, vehicle types, peak hours, and market conditions to provide fair and competitive pricing.

- **Four-Wheelers (FW)**: 1.0x (standard rate)

#### **Peak Hour Surcharges**

### 3. **Minimum Fares**
- **Two-Wheelers**: â‚¨100 minimum
- **Four-Wheelers**: â‚¨150 minimum

## ðŸ§® Calculation Formula

```
Final Fare = Base Rate Ã— Distance Ã— Vehicle Multiplier Ã— Time Multiplier Ã— Seat Factor Ã— Distance Factor Ã— (1 - Bulk Discount)
```

### Example Calculation
For a 20km trip in a petrol car during peak hours with 2 passengers:

```
Base Rate: â‚¨22.00/km
Distance: 20 km
Vehicle Multiplier: 1.0x (Four-wheeler)
Time Multiplier: 1.30x (Peak hour)
Seat Factor: 1.0x (Standard seats)
Distance Factor: 0.92x (Medium trip discount)
Bulk Discount: 0.05 (5% for 2 seats)

Fare = 22 Ã— 20 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.30 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 0.92 Ã— (1 - 0.05)
Fare = â‚¨499.12
```
